/// # Transaction Common Logic
///
/// This module provides reusable utility functions for transaction event handling 
/// and common operations used by both client and server transactions.
///
/// ## RFC 3261 Context
///
/// SIP transactions generate various events throughout their lifecycle as described in RFC 3261.
/// These events need to be communicated to the Transaction User (TU) as defined in
/// RFC 3261 Section 17. This module simplifies that communication with helper functions
/// that properly format and send standardized events.
///
/// ## Usage In Transaction Layer
///
/// These utility functions are used by different transaction types to:
/// 
/// 1. Send standardized events to the TU about state changes, responses, timeouts, etc.
/// 2. Process incoming responses based on their status codes
/// 3. Implement common behavior shared between different transaction types
///
/// By centralizing these common functions, the library ensures consistent behavior
/// across all transaction types while reducing code duplication.

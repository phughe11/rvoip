/// # Transaction State Machine
///
/// This module implements the SIP transaction state machines as defined in RFC 3261 Section 17.
/// It provides a thread-safe mechanism for tracking and transitioning between transaction states
/// while ensuring compliance with the RFC-defined state transition rules.
///
/// ## RFC 3261 Context
///
/// RFC 3261 defines four distinct transaction state machines:
///
/// 1. **INVITE Client Transaction** (Section 17.1.1)
/// 2. **Non-INVITE Client Transaction** (Section 17.1.2)
/// 3. **INVITE Server Transaction** (Section 17.2.1)
/// 4. **Non-INVITE Server Transaction** (Section 17.2.2)
///
/// Each state machine specifies the valid states and transitions for that transaction type,
/// as well as the events that trigger transitions (receiving messages, sending messages,
/// timer expirations).

/// # Server Transaction Module
///
/// This module implements the server-side transaction state machines according to 
/// [RFC 3261 Section 17.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261#section-17.2).
/// 
/// ## SIP Server Transactions
///
/// Server transactions are created when a SIP element receives a request from a client.
/// They ensure proper handling of requests, responses, and retransmissions according
/// to the SIP protocol specifications.
///
/// ## Transaction Types
///
/// RFC 3261 defines two types of server transactions with different state machines:
///
/// 1. **INVITE Server Transactions** (Section 17.2.1): Used for handling session establishment requests.
///    - More complex due to the three-way handshake (INVITE, response, ACK)
///    - Uses a four-state machine: Proceeding, Completed, Confirmed, and Terminated
///    - Uses timers G, H, and I for retransmission and timeout management
///    - Must handle ACK specially in the Completed state
///
/// 2. **Non-INVITE Server Transactions** (Section 17.2.2): Used for all other request types.
///    - Simpler state machine with three states: Trying, Proceeding, and Completed
///    - Uses timer J for state management
///    - No special handling for ACK required
///
/// ## Implementation Details
///
/// Both transaction types share common infrastructure but implement different state machines:
///
/// - `ServerInviteTransaction`: Implements the INVITE server transaction state machine
/// - `ServerNonInviteTransaction`: Implements the non-INVITE server transaction state machine
/// - `ServerTransactionData`: Shared data structure for both transaction types
/// - `CommonServerTransaction`: Common behavior for server transactions
/// - `ServerTransaction`: Interface for all server transactions
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// Server transactions are typically created by the `TransactionManager` when it receives
/// a request from the network. It routes incoming messages to the appropriate transaction
/// and provides a clean API for the Transaction User (TU) to send responses.

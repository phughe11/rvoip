//! Manages the lifecycle of SIP transaction timers and dispatches timer events.
//!
//! The [`TimerManager`] is responsible for:
//! - Registering and unregistering transactions that require timer services.
//! - Starting one-shot timer tasks that, upon expiration, send an [`InternalTransactionCommand::Timer`]
//!   event to the associated transaction.
//! - Holding timer settings applicable to its operations.
//!
//! # Timer Management in SIP
//!
//! RFC 3261 requires precise timer management for ensuring reliability in SIP transactions.
//! Both client and server transactions rely on various timers (A-K) to handle:
//!
//! - Message retransmissions over unreliable transports (e.g., UDP)
//! - Transaction timeouts
//! - Waiting periods for absorbing message retransmissions
//!
//! # Implementation Details
//!
//! This `TimerManager` provides a mechanism for scheduling a single notification after a
//! specified duration. For timers that require periodic firing or complex backoff strategies
//! (like RFC 3261 Timer A or E), the transaction itself, upon receiving a timer event,
//! is responsible for performing its action (e.g., retransmission) and then requesting the
//! `TimerManager` to start a new timer with the next appropriate duration.
//!
//! # Usage Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//! use tokio::sync::mpsc;
//! use rvoip_dialog_core::transaction::timer::TimerManager;
//! use rvoip_dialog_core::transaction::timer::TimerType;
//! use rvoip_dialog_core::transaction::{TransactionKey, InternalTransactionCommand};
//! use rvoip_sip_core::Method;
//!
//! # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // Create a timer manager
//! let timer_manager = Arc::new(TimerManager::new(None));
//!
//! // Create a transaction key and command channel
//! let tx_key = TransactionKey::new("z9hG4bK.456".to_string(), Method::Invite, false);
//! let (cmd_tx, mut cmd_rx) = mpsc::channel(10);
//!
//! // Register the transaction with the timer manager
//! timer_manager.register_transaction(tx_key.clone(), cmd_tx).await;
//!
//! // Start Timer A for this transaction (initial INVITE retransmission timer)
//! let timer_handle = timer_manager.start_timer(
//!     tx_key.clone(), 
//!     TimerType::A, 
//!     Duration::from_millis(500)
//! ).await?;
//!
//! // In your transaction event loop, handle timer events
//! tokio::spawn(async move {
//!     while let Some(cmd) = cmd_rx.recv().await {
//!         match cmd {
//!             InternalTransactionCommand::Timer(timer_name) => {
//!                 println!("Timer fired: {}", timer_name);
//!                 // Handle timer event (e.g., retransmit request, timeout transaction)
//!             },
//!             // Handle other commands...
//!             _ => {}
//!         }
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! # Ok(())
//! # }

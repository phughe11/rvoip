/// # SIP Transaction Layer
///
/// This module implements the SIP transaction layer as defined in RFC 3261 Section 17.
/// The transaction layer sits between the transport layer and the Transaction User (TU),
/// handling the mechanics of reliable message delivery and state management.
///
/// ## RFC 3261 Context
///
/// RFC 3261 defines the transaction layer as follows:
///
/// > The transaction layer handles application-layer retransmissions, matching of
/// > responses to requests, and application-layer timeouts. Any task that a User
/// > Agent Client (UAC) accomplishes takes place using a series of transactions.
///
/// The transaction layer's primary responsibilities include:
///
/// 1. **Message Retransmission**: Ensuring reliable delivery over unreliable transports (e.g., UDP)
/// 2. **Response Matching**: Associating responses with their corresponding requests
/// 3. **State Management**: Implementing the state machines for different transaction types
/// 4. **Timer Management**: Handling various timers for retransmissions, timeouts, and cleanup
/// 5. **Transaction Identification**: Uniquely identifying transactions using branch parameters
///
/// ## Transaction Types
///
/// RFC 3261 defines four distinct transaction types, each with its own state machine:
///
/// 1. **INVITE Client Transaction** (Section 17.1.1)
/// 2. **Non-INVITE Client Transaction** (Section 17.1.2)
/// 3. **INVITE Server Transaction** (Section 17.2.1)
/// 4. **Non-INVITE Server Transaction** (Section 17.2.2)
///

/// ## Implementation Details
///
/// This module provides:
///
/// 1. **Transaction Identification**: The `TransactionKey` struct for uniquely identifying transactions
/// 2. **State Management**: The `TransactionState` enum and `AtomicTransactionState` for thread-safe state tracking
/// 3. **Event Communication**: The `TransactionEvent` enum for communicating with the TU
/// 4. **Transaction Types**: The `TransactionKind` enum for distinguishing between transaction types
/// 5. **Transaction Interface**: The `Transaction` and `TransactionAsync` traits for uniform interaction
/// 6. **Timer Configuration**: The `TimerConfig` struct for configuring transaction timers
///
/// The implementation follows a trait-based design pattern where:
///
/// 1. Each transaction type implements the `TransactionLogic` trait
/// 2. A generic transaction runner uses this trait to drive the state machine
/// 3. The `TransactionManager` coordinates all active transactions
///
/// This architecture separates the transaction-specific behavior from the common
/// event loop machinery, making the code more maintainable and extensible.

/// This module provides the fundamental building blocks for implementing and managing
/// SIP transactions as specified in RFC 3261. It includes:
///
/// - [`TransactionKey`]: For uniquely identifying transactions.
/// - [`TransactionState`]: For representing the various states a transaction can be in.
/// - [`TransactionEvent`]: For communicating significant occurrences from the transaction layer
///   to a Transaction User (TU).
/// - [`TransactionKind`]: An enum to differentiate between client/server and INVITE/non-INVITE transactions.
/// - [`Transaction`]: An object-safe trait defining common synchronous operations on transactions.
/// - [`TransactionAsync`]: A trait for asynchronous operations, extending `Transaction`.
/// - [`InternalTransactionCommand`]: Commands used for internal control flow within a transaction's lifecycle.
/// - [`TimerConfig`]: Configuration for various transaction-related timers (T1, T2, T4, etc.).
///
/// The design separates synchronous state inspection (`Transaction`) from asynchronous state
/// modification and event processing (`TransactionAsync`), facilitating easier management and
/// interaction with transaction objects.
/// Distinguishes between the four fundamental types of SIP transactions based on the
/// request method (INVITE or other) and the role of the local SIP element (Client or Server).
///
/// This classification is crucial as each kind follows a distinct state machine as
/// defined in RFC 3261, Section 17.

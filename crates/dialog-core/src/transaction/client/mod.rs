/// # Client Transaction Module
///
/// This module implements the client-side transaction state machines according to 
/// [RFC 3261 Section 17.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261#section-17.1).
/// 
/// ## SIP Client Transactions
///
/// Client transactions are initiated by the Transaction User (TU) when it wants to send a request.
/// They ensure reliable delivery of requests, handle retransmissions, and deliver responses
/// back to the TU.
///
/// ## Transaction Types
///
/// RFC 3261 defines two types of client transactions with different state machines:
///
/// 1. **INVITE Client Transactions** (Section 17.1.1): Used for session establishment.
///    - More complex due to the three-way handshake required (INVITE, response, ACK)
///    - Special handling for ACK generation on non-2xx responses
///    - Unique timer requirements (Timers A, B, D)
///
/// 2. **Non-INVITE Client Transactions** (Section 17.1.2): Used for all other request types.
///    - Simpler state machine
///    - No ACK generation
///    - Different timer requirements (Timers E, F, K)
///
/// ## Implementation Details
///
/// Both transaction types share common infrastructure but implement different state machines:
///
/// - `ClientInviteTransaction`: Implements the INVITE client transaction state machine
/// - `ClientNonInviteTransaction`: Implements the non-INVITE client transaction state machine
/// - `ClientTransactionData`: Shared data structure for both transaction types
/// - `CommonClientTransaction`: Common behavior for client transactions
/// - `ClientTransaction`: Interface for all client transactions
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// Client transactions are typically created and managed by the `TransactionManager`, which routes
/// incoming messages to the appropriate transaction and exposes a clean API for the TU.

/// # Transaction Logic
///
/// This module defines the core trait that powers the different transaction state machines
/// required by RFC 3261 Section 17. It provides a flexible, reusable architecture for 
/// implementing the distinct behavior of INVITE and non-INVITE client and server transactions.
///
/// ## RFC 3261 Context
///
/// RFC 3261 defines four different transaction types, each with its own state machine:
///
/// 1. **INVITE Client Transaction** (Section 17.1.1)
/// 2. **Non-INVITE Client Transaction** (Section 17.1.2)  
/// 3. **INVITE Server Transaction** (Section 17.2.1)
/// 4. **Non-INVITE Server Transaction** (Section 17.2.2)
///
/// While each follows different rules for state transitions, retransmissions, and timeouts,
/// they share a common pattern: receiving messages, processing them based on the current state,
/// potentially changing state, and initiating appropriate timers.
///
/// ## Implementation Architecture
///
/// This module implements a trait-based design pattern where:
///
/// 1. The `TransactionLogic` trait defines the interface that all transaction types must implement
/// 2. Each concrete transaction type (e.g., `ClientInviteTransaction`) implements this trait
/// 3. A generic transaction runner in `runner.rs` uses this trait to drive the state machine
///
/// This architecture separates the transaction-specific behavior (how each type processes messages
/// and timers) from the common event loop machinery, reducing code duplication and making the
/// code more maintainable.

use std::sync::Arc;
 // Required for timer configurations
use tokio::sync::mpsc;

// Assuming these are accessible. Adjust paths if necessary.

/// Core trait defining the state machine logic for a SIP transaction type.
///
/// Implementors of this trait provide the transaction-specific behavior for handling
/// messages, timers, and state transitions according to the rules in RFC 3261 Section 17.
/// The generic transaction runner uses this trait to operate the transaction's state machine.
///
/// This trait follows the Strategy Pattern, allowing different transaction types to provide
/// their own implementations of how to process messages, handle timers, and react to state changes,
/// while reusing the common machinery of the event loop.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `D`: The transaction-specific data structure (e.g., `ClientTransactionData`, `ServerTransactionData`)
///   that contains the shared state and communication channels.
/// - `TH`: A struct holding `JoinHandle`s for the specific timers used by this transaction type.
///   For example, INVITE client transactions need handles for Timers A, B, and D, while
///   non-INVITE clients need handles for Timers E, F, and K.

//! # Routing Engine Implementation
//!
//! This module contains the core routing engine that makes intelligent decisions
//! about how to handle incoming calls, including direct agent assignment,
//! queue routing, and call rejection based on business rules and system capacity.

use crate::error::Result;

/// # Main Routing Engine for Call Distribution
///
/// The `RoutingEngine` is responsible for making intelligent routing decisions
/// for incoming calls. It evaluates multiple factors including agent availability,
/// skills matching, load balancing, business rules, and system capacity to
/// determine the best action for each call.
///
/// ## Decision Process
///
/// The routing engine follows this decision process:
///
/// 1. **Call Analysis**: Extract call metadata and requirements
/// 2. **Business Rules**: Apply time-based and policy-based rules
/// 3. **Agent Matching**: Find agents with appropriate skills and availability
/// 4. **Load Balancing**: Consider agent workload and performance
/// 5. **Queue Evaluation**: Determine appropriate queue if no direct routing
/// 6. **Capacity Check**: Ensure system can handle the call
/// 7. **Decision**: Route directly, queue, or reject the call
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ### Basic Routing
///
/// ```rust
/// use rvoip_call_engine::routing::{RoutingEngine, RoutingDecision};
/// 
/// # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// let routing_engine = RoutingEngine::new();
/// 
/// // Route an incoming support call
/// let decision = routing_engine.route_call("support-call-info").await?;
/// 
/// match decision {
///     RoutingDecision::DirectToAgent { agent_id } => {
///         println!("✅ Direct routing to agent: {}", agent_id);
///     }
///     RoutingDecision::Queue { queue_id } => {
///         println!("📋 Queuing in: {}", queue_id);
///     }
///     RoutingDecision::Reject { reason } => {
///         println!("❌ Call rejected: {}", reason);
///     }
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ### Advanced Usage with Business Logic
///
/// ```rust
/// use rvoip_call_engine::routing::RoutingEngine;
/// 
/// # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// let routing_engine = RoutingEngine::new();
/// 
/// // Route different types of calls
/// let support_decision = routing_engine.route_call("tech-support").await?;
/// let sales_decision = routing_engine.route_call("sales-inquiry").await?;
/// let vip_decision = routing_engine.route_call("vip-customer").await?;
/// 
/// // Each call type may have different routing logic
/// println!("Support: {:?}", support_decision);
/// println!("Sales: {:?}", sales_decision);
/// println!("VIP: {:?}", vip_decision);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
pub struct RoutingEngine {

}

impl RoutingEngine {
    /// Create a new routing engine
    ///
    /// Initializes a new routing engine with default policies and configurations.
    /// The engine is ready to make routing decisions immediately.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use rvoip_call_engine::routing::RoutingEngine;
    /// 
    /// let routing_engine = RoutingEngine::new();
    /// // Engine is ready to route calls
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Default Behavior
    ///
    /// - Uses default queue ("default") for most calls
    /// - No skill-based routing initially (requires configuration)
    /// - Basic load balancing across available agents
    /// - Standard business hour policies
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {}
    }
    
    /// Route an incoming call
    ///
    /// Analyzes the incoming call and determines the best routing action.
    /// This is the main entry point for all routing decisions in the call center.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `call_info` - String containing call metadata and requirements
    ///   Format depends on call center configuration but typically includes:
    ///   - Caller ID or customer information
    ///   - Call type or department requested
    ///   - Urgency or priority level
    ///   - Required skills or language preferences
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// Returns a [`RoutingDecision`] indicating how the call should be handled:
    /// - `DirectToAgent`: Route immediately to a specific agent
    /// - `Queue`: Place in a queue for later assignment
    /// - `Reject`: Refuse the call with a reason
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ### Simple Call Routing
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use rvoip_call_engine::routing::{RoutingEngine, RoutingDecision};
    /// 
    /// # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    /// let routing_engine = RoutingEngine::new();
    /// 
    /// let decision = routing_engine.route_call("standard-support-call").await?;
    /// 
    /// match decision {
    ///     RoutingDecision::DirectToAgent { agent_id } => {
    ///         println!("Connect to agent: {}", agent_id);
    ///     }
    ///     RoutingDecision::Queue { queue_id } => {
    ///         println!("Place in queue: {}", queue_id);
    ///     }
    ///     RoutingDecision::Reject { reason } => {
    ///         println!("Cannot handle call: {}", reason);
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// # Ok(())
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ### Handling Different Call Types
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use rvoip_call_engine::routing::{RoutingEngine, RoutingDecision};
    /// 
    /// # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    /// let routing_engine = RoutingEngine::new();
    /// 
    /// // Different call types may route differently
    /// let call_types = vec![
    ///     "emergency-support",
    ///     "billing-inquiry", 
    ///     "sales-lead",
    ///     "customer-complaint"
    /// ];
    /// 
    /// for call_type in call_types {
    ///     let decision = routing_engine.route_call(call_type).await?;
    ///     println!("{}: {:?}", call_type, decision);
    /// }
    /// # Ok(())
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Routing Logic (Current Implementation)
    ///
    /// The current implementation uses a simple default routing strategy:
    /// - All calls are routed to the "default" queue
    /// - Future versions will implement sophisticated routing logic
    ///
    /// # Future Enhancements
    ///
    /// Planned routing features include:
    /// - Skill-based matching with agent capabilities
    /// - Load balancing across available agents
    /// - Business hour and time-based routing
    /// - Customer tier and VIP routing
    /// - Geographic and language-based routing
    /// - Real-time capacity and queue management
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns `CallCenterError::Routing` for routing-specific errors such as:
    /// - Invalid call information format
    /// - No available routing options
    /// - System overload conditions
    /// - Policy violations
    pub async fn route_call(&self, _call_info: &str) -> Result<RoutingDecision> {
        // TODO: Implement sophisticated routing logic
        // Current implementation: route everything to default queue
        
        // Future implementation will include:
        // 1. Parse call_info to extract requirements
        // 2. Query agent registry for available agents
        // 3. Match skills and availability
        // 4. Apply business rules and policies
        // 5. Consider load balancing
        // 6. Check queue capacity
        // 7. Make optimal routing decision

            queue_id: "default".to_string()

/// # Routing Decision Types
///
/// Represents the possible routing decisions that the routing engine can make
/// for an incoming call. Each decision type has different implications for
/// call handling and customer experience.
///
/// ## Decision Priority
///
/// The routing engine prioritizes decisions in this order:
/// 1. **DirectToAgent**: Best customer experience (immediate connection)
/// 2. **Queue**: Acceptable experience (short wait expected)
/// 3. **Reject**: Last resort (system protection)
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ### Pattern Matching on Decisions
///
/// ```rust
/// use rvoip_call_engine::routing::RoutingDecision;
/// 
/// # fn example(decision: RoutingDecision) {
/// match decision {
///     RoutingDecision::DirectToAgent { agent_id } => {
///         println!("🎯 Direct routing to agent: {}", agent_id);
///         // Immediately connect call to agent
///         // Update agent status to busy
///         // Start call timer and logging
///     }
///     RoutingDecision::Queue { queue_id } => {
///         println!("📋 Queuing call in: {}", queue_id);
///         // Add call to specified queue
///         // Provide estimated wait time to caller
///         // Play queue music or announcements
///     }
///     RoutingDecision::Reject { reason } => {
///         println!("❌ Rejecting call: {}", reason);
///         // Send busy signal or play rejection message
///         // Log rejection reason for analysis
///         // Potentially offer callback or alternative
///     }
/// }
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ### Creating Decisions Programmatically
///
/// ```rust
/// use rvoip_call_engine::routing::RoutingDecision;
/// 
/// # fn example() {
/// // Direct agent assignment
/// let direct_routing = RoutingDecision::DirectToAgent {
///     agent_id: "agent-alice-001".to_string()
/// };
/// 
/// // Queue assignment with priority
/// let queue_routing = RoutingDecision::Queue {
///     queue_id: "high-priority-support".to_string()
/// };
/// 
/// // Call rejection with explanation
/// let rejection = RoutingDecision::Reject {
///     reason: "All agents busy, try again later".to_string()
/// };
/// # }
/// ```

pub enum RoutingDecision {
    /// Route call directly to a specific agent
    ///
    /// This is the optimal outcome for customer experience as it provides
    /// immediate connection to an available agent. The agent must be:
    /// - Currently available (not on another call)
    /// - Have appropriate skills for the call
    /// - Within capacity limits (not exceeding max concurrent calls)
    ///

        agent_id: String 
    },
    
    /// Route call to a queue for later assignment
    ///
    /// Used when no agents are immediately available or when call requires
    /// queuing due to business rules. The call will wait in the specified
    /// queue until an appropriate agent becomes available.
    ///
    /// # Fields
    /// * `queue_id` - Identifier of the target queue
    Queue { 
        /// Identifier of the queue where the call should wait
        queue_id: String 
    },
    
    /// Reject the call with a reason
    ///
    /// Used when the system cannot handle the call due to:
    /// - System overload (all queues full)
    /// - Business rule violations (after hours, restricted caller)
    /// - No suitable agents or queues available
    /// - Technical issues preventing call handling
    ///
    /// # Fields
    /// * `reason` - Human-readable explanation for the rejection
